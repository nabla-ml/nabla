# Core

The fundamental building blocks of Nabla.

## Tensor

The core n-dimensional array class with Mojo-backed compute and autodiff support.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:hidden:

tensor/index
```

## Sharding

SPMD device mesh, partition specs, and automatic tensor sharding.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:hidden:

sharding/index
```

## Autograd

Computational graph construction, backward pass, and gradient accumulation internals.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:hidden:

autograd/index
```

## Context

Execution context management: device selection, no-grad mode, and computation flags.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:hidden:

context/index
```

## Types

Core type definitions: `DType`, `Device`, `Shape`, and related primitives.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:hidden:

types/index
```

## PyTree

Utilities for working with nested Python structures (lists, dicts, tuples) of tensors.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1
:hidden:

pytree/index
```
