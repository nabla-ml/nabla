"""DEPRECATED:
The `max.driver` Mojo API is being deprecated in favor of the open source
`gpu.host` API, which has better ergonomics, and is more feature complete.

APIs to interact with devices.

Although there are several modules in this `max.driver` package, you'll get
everything you need from this top-level `driver` namespace, so you don't need
to import each module.

For example, the basic code you need to create tensor on CPU looks like this:

```python
from nabla.compiler.driver import Tensor, cpu
from testing import assert_equal
from nabla.compiler.tensor import TensorShape

def main():
    tensor = Tensor[DType.float32, rank=2](TensorShape(1,2))
    tensor[0, 0] = 1.0

    # You can also explicitly set the devices.
    device = cpu()
    new_tensor = Tensor[DType.float32, rank=2](TensorShape(1,2), device)
    new_tensor[0, 0] = 1.0

    # You can also create slices of tensor
    subtensor = tensor[:, :1]
    assert_equal(subtensor[0, 0], tensor[0, 0])
```
