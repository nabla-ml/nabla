    """Describes the encoding for a data type that can be quantized.

    Any type that conforms to this trait implicitly knows the relationship
    between the buffer and tensor layout for its quantization encoding.
    In particular, the `quantize()` function takes in a tensor with a logical
    shape in terms of its elements. Then it returns a uint8 tensor with a
    different shape that instead describes the shape of the bytes storage
    buffer after applying the quantization encoding.
