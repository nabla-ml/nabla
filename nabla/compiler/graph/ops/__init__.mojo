"""Implements various ops used when building a graph.

Although the following modules provide a lot of the ops you want when building
a graph, you can also use functions in
[`Graph`](/max/api/mojo/graph/graph/Graph) to add constant values,
such as [`constant()`](/max/api/mojo/graph/graph/Graph#constant),
[`vector()`](/max/api/mojo/graph/graph/Graph#vector), and
[`scalar()`](/max/api/mojo/graph/graph/Graph#scalar).

The [`Symbol`](/max/api/mojo/graph/symbol/Symbol) type (returned by
all ops) also implements various dunder methods to support operations between
symbols, such as `+` add, `*` multiply, and `@` matmul, plus convenience
methods such as
[`reshape()`](/max/api/mojo/graph/symbol/Symbol#reshape) and
[`swapaxes()`](/max/api/mojo/graph/symbol/Symbol#swapaxes)."""
