# Failing Unit Tests

| Test File | Failure Mode | Root Cause (Estimated) |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| `tests/unit/test_control_flow.py` | `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in `TestCondOp.test_cond_basic_true` | `max.driver.Buffer.from_dlpack` fails on scalar boolean arrays (`()` shape) during `nb.constant(True, dtype=nb.DType.bool)`. |
| `tests/unit/test_hessian_physical_ops.py` | `ValueError: Failed to run the MOToMGP pass manager: error: input shape not broadcastable to result shape` | Hessian calculation with `broadcast_to_physical` using `fwd_fwd` mode fails MAX compilation due to shape mismatch in generated MLIR. |
| `tests/unit/test_physical_ops.py` | `AssertionError` & `RuntimeError` | `test_broadcast_preserves_sharding` fails logical shape assertion. Also `test_broadcast_to_realize` fails MAX compilation when sharded. |
| `tests/unit/test_transforms_composition.py` | `AssertionError: (shapes (2, 1, 4), (2, 3, 4) mismatch)` | `TestVmapVJP.test_vmap_vjp_matmul` fails due to shape mismatch in `vmap(vjp)` composition. |
| `tests/unit/test_vjp.py` | `RuntimeError: Failed to compile the model.` | `TestVJPView.test_vjp_broadcast_to` fails MAX compilation. Likely related to the reduction generated by `broadcast_to` VJP. |
