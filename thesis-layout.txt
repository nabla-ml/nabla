THESIS STRUCTURE: Automatic Differentiation - Theory and Implementation
=====================================================================

ORIGINAL RESEARCH CONTEXT (for AI assistants):
==============================================
**Thesis Topic**: "Nabla - Theory and Practice of Automatic Differentiation"
**Degree**: Master's Thesis
**Timeline**: 1-year development project

**What has been completed:**
- Theoretical/mathematical section on AD fundamentals (20-30 pages already written)
- Full implementation of an AD framework in Python called "Nabla"
- Core function transformations: vjp (reverse-mode AD), jvp (forward-mode AD), vmap (vectorization), jit (compilation)
- Performance comparable to JAX on CPU and single GPU training scenarios
- Integration with MAX graph compiler (similar to XLA) for JIT compilation
- Eager mode execution using NumPy for immediate array operations

**Current Challenge:**
The author needs help structuring the PRACTICAL section of the thesis. The theoretical foundation is complete, but they need guidance on how to present the implementation aspects, core abstractions, system architecture, and validation approach.

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- Built a complete AD system with composable function transformations
- Achieved JAX-level performance through careful design
- Unique feature: seamless integration of custom Mojo kernels for unified CPU/GPU acceleration
- All four transformations (vjp, jvp, vmap, jit) work together naturally

**Validation Approach:**
- Primarily validated against JAX (established gold standard)
- No custom numerical differentiation testing implemented
- Focus on correctness and performance parity with existing frameworks

**Target Audience for Practical Section:**
- Readers with mathematical AD background (theory section provides this)
- No assumed knowledge of compilers or AD implementation details
- Should be "idiot-proof" - buildable from first principles

**Additional Notes:**
- Memory checkpointing implemented but not yet integrated into main codebase
- Batch dimensions system is key architectural decision (not novel, used in JAX too)
- Want to maintain focus on AD throughout, with compilation as supporting technology

READER'S ROADMAP - What You'll Learn:
====================================
This section builds your understanding step by step:
1. First, understand the design philosophy behind modern AD systems
2. Then, see how arrays really work (memory + metadata)
3. Next, learn how we capture computations as graphs
4. Understand how batch processing works elegantly
5. Build up to automatic differentiation (the main event)
6. See how everything composes to create powerful tools
7. Finally, understand how compilation makes it all fast

Prerequisites: Chapters 2-4 provide the mathematical and computational foundation
Outcome: Complete understanding of how to build modern AD frameworks

5.1 Design Philosophy and Architectural Choices (4-5 pages)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Core principle: Composable transformations over monolithic solutions
  * Why small, focused transformations (vjp, jvp, vmap, jit) instead of one big system
  * Mathematical elegance: each transformation solves exactly one problem
  * Practical benefit: transformations compose naturally to create complex behaviors
- Key architectural decisions and their rationale:
  * Batch dimensions as separate metadata (not part of regular shape)
  * Trace representation as explicit computation graphs
  * Delegation of memory management to MAX compiler
  * NumPy integration for eager execution
- Comparison with alternative approaches:
  * Why not symbolic computation (like SymPy)?
  * Why not operator overloading without traces?
  * Why not compile-only (no eager mode)?
- Design trade-offs and their implications:
  * Simplicity vs. feature completeness
  * Performance vs. implementation complexity
  * Flexibility vs. optimization opportunities

5.2 Array Representation and Memory Layout (4-5 pages)
------------------------------------------------------
- What an Array fundamentally is: pointer to buffer + shape + stride + offset
  * Visual diagram: show actual memory layout of a 2D array
  * Concrete example: [1,2,3,4,5,6] stored as 2x3 matrix
- Detailed example: transpose operation as a view transformation
  * Before: matrix[i,j] = buffer[i*3 + j] (row-major order)
  * After transpose: matrix[j,i] = buffer[i*3 + j] (same buffer, different indexing)
  * Show how transpose changes strides without moving data
  * Demonstrate memory efficiency: O(1) operation vs O(n) data copy
- Nabla's abstraction approach: delegating low-level memory layout to NumPy/MAX
  * Why this still matters: some operations require manual stride/offset manipulation (e.g. padding)
  * Reader takeaway: Arrays are views into memory, not just data containers

5.3 Program Trace Representation (5-6 pages)
--------------------------------------------
- Why we need traces: enabling function transformations beyond eager execution
  * Eager execution: operations happen immediately, results computed now (like NumPy)
  * Problem: for transformations (AD, JIT, etc.), we need to "replay" the computation
  * Solution: capture the computation as a graph while it runs
- How computational graphs are built through array references
  * Every array can remember which operation created it (optional tracking)
  * Every operation remembers its input arrays when needed
  * Example: c = a + b potentially creates reference: c.parent_op = Add, Add.inputs = [a, b]
- Building the complete computation graph:
  * Start from output arrays and trace backwards through parent operations
  * DFS/topological ordering to get proper execution order
  * Convert captured graph to edge list representation
  * Result: DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) representing the entire computation
- Concrete trace example: Step-by-step walkthrough
  * Function: f(x, y) = x * y + sin(x)
  * Show actual data structures created during tracing
  * Demonstrate eager vs traced execution side-by-side
  * Include code snippets showing the difference
- Visualizing traces with nabla.xpr():
  * Show what a basic trace looks like in readable format
  * Demonstrate how operations and data flow are represented
  * Example output from nabla.xpr() for the above function
- When traces are needed vs. eager execution
  * Eager: for immediate results (normal array operations)
  * Traced: when we need to apply transformations (VJP, JVP, JIT)
  * User doesn't think about this - transformations handle tracing automatically
- Lifecycle of trace references during transformations
  * Build phase: capture the computation graph
  * Transform phase: traverse and analyze the graph (e.g., build backward pass)
  * Execute phase: run the transformed computation
  * Cleanup: release references when transformation is complete

5.4 Batch Dimensions and VMAP Transformation (5-6 pages)
--------------------------------------------------------
- The core problem VMAP solves: **Applying a function designed for single inputs to multiple inputs**
  * Example: You have function f(x) that works on shape [10, 20]
  * You want to apply f to 100 different inputs: shape [100, 10, 20]
  * Traditional approach: write a loop and call f 100 times
  * VMAP approach: automatically vectorize f to handle the batch dimension
- Nabla's approach: separate `batch_dims` field alongside regular `shape`
  * Regular shape: [10, 20] (the computation dimensions)
  * Batch dims: [100] (the vectorization dimensions)
  * Key insight: operations need to know which dimensions are "batch" vs "computation"
- How VMAP works WITHOUT needing a trace:
  * **Input processing**: takes axis specification (e.g., axis=0) and moves that axis to batch_dims
  * **Output processing**: moves batch dimensions back to regular shape according to out_axes
  * **Magic**: The function runs normally, but all operations automatically handle batch_dims
- The `incr_batch_dim_ctr` and `decr_batch_dim_ctr` operations:
  * These operations move dimensions between shape and batch_dims
  * Input: move axis from shape to batch_dims (incr_batch_dim_ctr)
  * Output: move axis from batch_dims back to shape (decr_batch_dim_ctr)
- Batch dimension propagation through computation graph
  * Rule: all operations automatically inherit and propagate batch_dims
  * Example: if inputs have batch_dims=[100], all intermediate results have batch_dims=[100]
- Concrete example walkthrough showing the dimension shuffling process
  * Before VMAP: inputs have shape=[100, 10, 20], batch_dims=[]
  * After input processing: shape=[10, 20], batch_dims=[100]
  * During computation: all operations work on shape=[10, 20] but track batch_dims=[100]
  * After output processing: final result has shape=[100, result_shape], batch_dims=[]
- Visualizing VMAP with nabla.xpr():
  * Show how batch_dims appear in different colors in the trace output
  * Demonstrate the dimension shuffling operations in the program representation
  * Example showing before/during/after VMAP transformation

5.5 VJP (Reverse Mode AD) - "Backpropagation Generalized" (5-6 pages)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- What VJP actually computes: Vector-Jacobian Products
  * Given function f: R^n → R^m and vector v ∈ R^m
  * VJP computes v^T · J_f (where J_f is the Jacobian matrix)
  * Why this is useful: gradients of scalar functions (like loss functions)
- Building on trace representation: how VJP uses the captured DAG
  * Forward pass: build the computation graph + compute values
  * Backward pass: traverse graph in reverse topological order
  * Each operation defines its "pullback" function
- Constructing the backward pass from forward trace
  * For each operation in reverse order: apply its pullback
  * Accumulate gradients flowing into each array
  * Example walkthrough: f(x,y) = x*y + sin(x)
- Visualizing VJP transformation with nabla.xpr():
  * Show the original forward computation trace
  * Show the transformed backward computation trace
  * Highlight how pullback operations are inserted
  * Demonstrate gradient accumulation in the program representation
- How batch_dims interact with gradient computation
  * Gradients respect batch structure
  * Batch dimensions are preserved through backward pass
- Implementation details using established tracing concepts
  * Pullback functions and their composition
  * Memory management during backward pass

5.6 JVP (Forward Mode AD) - "Dual Numbers in Practice" (4-5 pages)
------------------------------------------------------------------
- What JVP actually computes: Jacobian-Vector Products
  * Given function f: R^n → R^m and vector v ∈ R^n
  * JVP computes J_f · v (where J_f is the Jacobian matrix)
  * Why this is useful: directional derivatives, few inputs/many outputs
- Forward mode implementation leveraging trace infrastructure
  * Dual numbers concept: carry value + derivative simultaneously
  * Each operation defines its "pushforward" function
  * Example walkthrough: same f(x,y) = x*y + sin(x) but forward mode
- Visualizing JVP transformation with nabla.xpr():
  * Show how dual number computations appear in the trace
  * Demonstrate pushforward operations in the program representation
  * Compare with VJP trace to highlight the differences
- Comparison with VJP in terms of trace usage and batch handling
  * VJP: trace for backward pass, efficient for many inputs/few outputs
  * JVP: trace for forward pass, efficient for few inputs/many outputs
  * Computational complexity comparison: when to use which
- When to use forward vs. reverse mode
  * Rule of thumb: reverse mode when outputs << inputs
  * Forward mode when inputs << outputs
  * Higher-order derivatives: composition considerations

5.7 Higher-Order Derivatives Through Composition (4-5 pages)
------------------------------------------------------------
- The power of composable transformations: why small building blocks matter
  * Each transformation (vjp, jvp, vmap) solves one specific problem
  * Composing them creates powerful higher-order capabilities
  * Mathematical elegance: transformations compose naturally
- **jacfwd** and **jacrev**: building Jacobian computation from basic pieces
  * jacfwd = vmap(jvp, ...) - vectorize forward mode for full Jacobian rows
  * jacrev = vmap(vjp, ...) - vectorize reverse mode for full Jacobian columns
  * When to use which: depends on input/output dimensions
- The elegance of **vmap(grad(f))**: vectorized gradient computation
  * grad(f) = vjp-based gradient of scalar function
  * vmap(grad(f)) = gradients of many scalar functions simultaneously
  * Real-world example: computing gradients across a batch of loss functions
- Visualizing composed transformations with nabla.xpr():
  * Show how vmap(grad(f)) appears in the program representation
  * Demonstrate the nested transformation structure
  * Highlight how batch_dims and gradient computations interact
- How batch_dims enable efficient vectorized AD
  * Traditional approach: explicit loops over batch elements
  * Nabla approach: batch_dims automatically vectorize all operations
  * Performance benefit: single vectorized operation vs. many small operations
- Composition complexity and performance implications
  * Different composition orders have different computational costs
  * When composition becomes expensive and how to optimize

5.8 JIT Compilation and Graph Optimization (4-5 pages)
------------------------------------------------------
- Why JIT compilation matters for AD: removing Python overhead
  * Problem: Python function calls are expensive
  * Solution: compile entire computation to native code
  * Benefit: 10x-100x speedup for numerical computations
- Integration with MAX graph compiler: high-level ML graph compilation
  * MAX provides functionality similar to XLA (Google's compiler for JAX/TensorFlow)
  * Handles optimization, memory management, and code generation
  * Supports both CPU and GPU execution
  * Provides intrinsic parallelization capabilities
- The "unmaterialized" array concept:
  * Key insight: we don't need actual data to compile
  * Unmaterialized arrays: contain shape/type info but no data
  * Marking all inputs as unmaterialized at compilation time
- Unmaterialized array markers and propagation:
  * Propagation of unmaterialized state through computation
  * Every operation checks: "are my inputs unmaterialized?"
  * If yes: create unmaterialized output, record the operation
  * Result: building program trace without real data
- Translation process:
  * Step 1: Run function with unmaterialized inputs → get trace
  * Step 2: Convert Nabla trace to MAX-compatible representation
  * Step 3: MAX compiles trace to optimized native code
  * Step 4: Execute compiled code on actual data
- Visualizing JIT compilation with nabla.xpr():
  * Show the unmaterialized trace representation
  * Demonstrate how compilation preserves program structure
  * Highlight optimizations that become visible in the compiled form
- Compilation reuse for repeated efficient execution
