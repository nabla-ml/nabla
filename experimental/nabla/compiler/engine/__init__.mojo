"""DEPRECATED:
The Mojo graph and engine APIs are being deprecated. Internally we build graphs
using the Python APIs, and our engineering efforts have been focused on that. As
a result, the Mojo version has not kept pace with new features and language
improvements. These APIs will be open sourced for the community in a future
patch prior to being removed.

APIs to run inference with MAX Engine.

Although there are several modules in this `max.engine` package, you'll get
everything you need from this top-level `engine` namespace, so you don't need
to import each module.

For example, the basic code you need to run an inference looks like this:

```python
from max import engine

def main():
    # Load your model:
    var session = engine.InferenceSession()
    var model = session.load(model_path)

    # Get the inputs, then run an inference:
    var outputs = model.execute(inputs)
    # Process the outputs here.
```
