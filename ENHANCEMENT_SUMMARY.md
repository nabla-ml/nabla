# Nabla Framework Enhancement Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Added Logarithm Operation (`LogOp`)
**File:** `/nabla/ops/unary.py`
- **Implementation:** Natural logarithm operation with proper VJP/JVP rules
- **VJP Rule:** `∂f/∂x = 1/x` (derivative of log(x))
- **JVP Rule:** Same derivative applied to tangents
- **Safety Features:** 
  - Epsilon handling in eager mode to prevent `log(0)` errors
  - Uses `np.maximum(input_array, epsilon)` with `epsilon = 1e-15`
- **Global Instance:** `_log_op` available for efficient reuse
- **API:** `nabla.log(x)` function

### 2. Added Power Operation (`PowerOp`)
**File:** `/nabla/ops/binary.py`
- **Implementation:** Power operation `x^y` with mathematically correct derivatives
- **VJP Rules:**
  - `∂f/∂x = y × x^(y-1)` → computed as `y × output / x`
  - `∂f/∂y = x^y × ln(x)` → computed as `output × ln(x)`
- **JVP Rules:** Properly handles both partial derivatives for forward-mode AD
- **Optimization:** Reuses computed output to avoid redundant power calculations
- **Global Instance:** `_power_op` available for efficient reuse
- **API:** `nabla.pow(x, y)` function

### 3. Fixed Division Operation (`DivOp`)
**File:** `/nabla/ops/binary.py`
- **Issue:** Previous VJP/JVP rules were incorrect
- **Fix:** Implemented proper quotient rule derivatives:
  - `∂f/∂x = 1/y` (derivative of x/y with respect to x)
  - `∂f/∂y = -x/y²` (derivative of x/y with respect to y)
- **Both VJP and JVP:** Now correctly implement the mathematical derivatives
- **Backward Compatibility:** No API changes, existing code works correctly

### 4. Enhanced MLP Training Test
**File:** `/tests/integration/test_mlp.py`
- **Random Initialization:** Uses `nabla.randn()` with different seeds for each parameter
- **Larger Network:** 3-layer MLP architecture (1 → 8 → 8 → 1)
- **Better Task:** Learning sin function `sin(2πx)` for x ∈ [0,1]
- **Training Data:** 16 samples with proper input/output pairs
- **Improvements:**
  - Higher learning rate (0.1) for faster convergence
  - More training epochs (10 vs 3)
  - Better activation functions (sin instead of ReLU)
  - Proper MSE loss normalization
  - Test predictions on specific values

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
**Files:** 
- `/tests/integration/test_new_operations.py` - Tests all new operations
- `/tests/verification/test_no_warnings.py` - Verifies no numpy warnings

## Technical Implementation Details

### Mathematical Correctness
All derivative implementations follow standard calculus rules:

**Logarithm:** 
```
d/dx log(x) = 1/x
```

**Power (x^y):**
```
∂/∂x (x^y) = y × x^(y-1)
∂/∂y (x^y) = x^y × ln(x)
```

**Division (x/y):**
```
∂/∂x (x/y) = 1/y
∂/∂y (x/y) = -x/y²
```

### Safety Features
1. **Log Operation:** Epsilon handling prevents `log(0)` and `log(negative)` errors
2. **Power Operation:** Works safely with positive bases and reasonable exponents
3. **Division Operation:** Handles division by reasonable denominators

### Framework Integration
- All operations integrate seamlessly with existing VJP/JVP infrastructure
- Global operation instances provide efficiency
- Proper circular import handling between modules
- Consistent API patterns with existing operations

## Testing Results
